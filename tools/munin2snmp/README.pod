=head1 NAME

munin2snmp - SNMP Agent to query munin-node over snmp

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Net::SNMP, Getopt::Long, Pod::Usage perl modules, munin-node with some plugins

=head2 Example configuration

/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

  master       agentx
  agentAddress udp:127.0.0.1:161
  rocommunity  public 127.0.0.1

On a newer system it is enough to define "master" option only

MUNIN-MIB should be installed on the client,
it goes to /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs or /usr/share/munin/mibs
or another place where snmpd expects to find the MIB files.

See also http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ:MIBs_03

It is possible to start munin2snmp as non-root user, for example
run munin2snmp as Debian-snmp user on Debian Stretch:

fix the /var/agentx permissions:

  chmod  g+rx /var/agentx
  chgrp Debian-snmp /var/agentx

add to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf: 

  master          agentx
  agentXperms 0640 0550 Debian-snmp Debian-snmp

restart snmpd and start the agent as Debian-snmp:

  su -l Debian-snmp -s /bin/bash -c "/tmp/munin2snmp.pl --pidfile /tmp/munin2snmp.pid --plugins iostat,vmstat"

=head2 Usage

After setting up snmpd, start the agent:

  ./munin2snmp

Now one can query the agent

  snmpwalk -v 2c -mMUNIN-MIB  -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.123456.100.1.1

where "1.3.6.1.4.1.123456.100.1.1" is example OID selected as the base
tree for the agent.

Change  OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the MUNIN-MIB file if you plan to use a different OID.

You might need to change the host, port, oidbase and munin_plugins you want to use.

The defaults:

  $Munin{PORT} = '4949';
  $Munin{HOST} = 'localhost'
  $oidbase = ".1.3.6.1.4.1.123456.100.1.1"
  @munin_plugins = qw ( load cpu df );

One can override the defaults by creating /etc/munin2snmp.conf file with the following
configuration options:

  munin_port    = [port]
  munin_host    = [host]
  base_oid      = [oid]
  munin_plugins = [comma separated list of munin-node plugins]

Or by specifying the parameters, see munin2snmp --help for the usage
